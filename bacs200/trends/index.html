                <h3>Artificial Intelligence Chatbots</h3>
                <p>One particular web development trend that is really interesting to analyze is the concept of chatbots. Essentially a chatbot is an artificial intelligence interaction between a person using the internet and the company whomever is responsible for interacting with that person. For example if a person is trying to purchase something on the Internet and they need help, they would ask for help in the chat section which is where the chat would come into play. Thischatbot is not an actual person, but is an artificial representation that can help answer questions and lead a person to make a decision. I have had experience using chatbots online and it is really interesting because they actually do a pretty good job at getting you what you need. Personally I like the personal interaction with a person, but I definitely don't mind using them if it's just a simple quick question that I need answered. Normal concerns with chatbots is that this is going to take away jobs from people and potentially allow for misinformation from the chatbots to be ineffective. Although this is true to a certain extent, I think the benefits potentially outweigh the cons in this case. Website developers are simply trying to make the best product they can for the most reasonable price they can, and allowing these chat bot to interact with customers as a way to improve the overall customer experience. At the end of the day a customer just wants to purchase something that they need and isnâ€™t always concerned with the means in which they get it.

                <p>One of the pros towards addressing climate change would be that it is an opportunity for the entire world to be United politically under the same goal of preserving environmental sustainability. This is a great way for Nations to collaboratively compete with one another and produce more sustainable products and promote the industry. Innovation in this case leads to great success and allows for the advancement of Nations and new political ideas. Additionally This is a great tool to put pressure on other countries to focus resources on better areas that can help promote more jobs within a country and opportunities that were otherwise not there. Climate change is something that would technically affect all the world, so the world can come together to combat this issue.

                <h3>PROS</h3>
                <p>A few points in favor of combating climate change is that if climate change is not acted upon then it will continue to change millions of poor people who face greater challenges and extreme health and protect their livelihood. At the rate that the Earth would change, people would be subjected to Greater catastrophe and need to help one another which may not be easily done. If action is not taken as well, people may become displaced very easily and forced to move which can cause strain upon society as a whole. This displacement can cause a loss of Education, language, and overall cultural heritage that is necessary and being able to commune with several different types of people. An effort to combat this in theory would preserve the social order and overall characteristics that make up a society and how it can function in a first world country.
