  <h1 class="display-2">Artificial Intelligence Chatbots</h1>

                <p>One particular web development trend that is really interesting to analyze is the concept of chatbots. Essentially a chatbot is an artificial intelligence interaction between a person using the internet and the company whomever is responsible for interacting with that person. For example if a person is trying to purchase something on the Internet and they need help, they would ask for help in the chat section which is where the chat would come into play. Thischatbot is not an actual person, but is an artificial representation that can help answer questions and lead a person to make a decision. I have had experience using chatbots online and it is really interesting because they actually do a pretty good job at getting you what you need. Personally I like the personal interaction with a person, but I definitely don't mind using them if it's just a simple quick question that I need answered. Normal concerns with chatbots is that this is going to take away jobs from people and potentially allow for misinformation from the chatbots to be ineffective. Although this is true to a certain extent, I think the benefits potentially outweigh the cons in this case. Website developers are simply trying to make the best product they can for the most reasonable price they can, and allowing these chat bot to interact with customers as a way to improve the overall customer experience. At the end of the day a customer just wants to purchase something that they need and isn’t always concerned with the means in which they get it.

 <h1 class="display-2">YouTube is a Political Hotbutton</h1> 
<br>   
<br>
     <div class="container mt-5">
        <div class="row">

            <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                <p>As a young person, I grew up watching YouTube All the time and I consistently watch it on a  weekly basis. One of the things that is in contention is the concept of Regulation and the dislike button. This trend is almost like kind of a mix between political and web development because although the development of YouTube is increasing people's exposure to different platforms and media itself, there's also political implications for what people can watch and what they cannot watch. As I mentioned before, the dislike button is really interesting because YouTube is thinking about taking away the dislike button which I think is a bad thing. As users, we are responsible for censoring and filtering the type of content that we want to see based on disliking things or liking them. If something isn't pleasing to us we down voted and we are not giving that content, it is also a way to show that content is bad and should be  Frowned upon. The question is, can YouTube and Google for all that matter sensor people's ability to censor their own information? Over the coming decade this will be a huge point of discussion for everyone online trying to look for information and credible data. This could be a potential issue politically for YouTube as certain YouTube platforms have been canceled and removed from YouTube based on their own guidelines. When does the company become so big and so influential that they have to answer to the legal implications of how people react to their product. This will be an interesting process that will unfold over the coming years</p>

  <h1 class="display-2">Voice Search Optimization</h1>
<br>   
<br>
     <div class="container mt-5">
        <div class="row">
       
            <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                <p>The trend that is very rapidly growing is voice search. Essentially this is utilizing voice commands through a medium such as Siri  in order to search on Google and access content that a user's desiring. A lot of people say “Hey Siri”, and they will ask her to look up something such as restaurants near me and she will perform the action for them. This web development trend is limiting the amount of time it takes to get information that a person's Desiring. At any possible moment a user can get the information that they need quickly and very easily. Although this is incredibly amazing and a wonderful asset to have for when you're  doing something such as driving and aren't able to press buttons,  it has consequences. I personally think that Society is becoming less intelligent because we rely on the internet for all of our answers. If we can just voice type something in rather than taking the effort to punch it in We are Becoming lazier and less equipped when such a technology fails. I know from my personal experience that when voice search doesn't work as easily, and I have to type something in I get super frustrated. This is very funny because this is the way it was always done and I never had a problem typing it in till I found out there is an easier way. I also think that this type of data can be analyzed based on what people are asking in the manner in which they're asking it. Potential voice inflection can be assumed with better technology and understanding how people are asking such questions.  I'm really interested to see where this technology is going, but I think that it also has its consequences and we need to be careful. In fact, I think it's very interesting too because I actually wrote this entire paragraph just using my voice!
