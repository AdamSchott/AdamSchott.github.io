<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Hello everyone, my name is Adam Schott and this is my final semester at UNC. I'm from the small town of Eaton, CO  here in Northern Colorado. I have been married to my wonderful wife for two years now, and we are  in the process of building a house. My family Works in agriculture and I have two younger sisters, one who will be starting her freshman year of high school. As far as my hobbies are concerned, I enjoy regularly playing old manâ€™s basketball and spending time outside. I also work in landscaping when I'm not in class and enjoy flowers, shrubs, and trees. Once I graduate, I hope to land a job doing marketing/management in an agricultural or environmentally related field. Looking forward to a good semester!
</li>
</ul>  	  
	  
<h2>Background:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>My background is mostly in agriculture and Horticulture, but I've had the pleasure of doing several different types of work and my shorts 6 years out of high school. When I graduated high school I began working at a local Nursery named Eaton Grove Nursery, which is where I learned an incredible amount about plants, trees, and the science between them for three years. Once I finished Gathering my knowledge there I had an opportunity to work for a ditch company in Fort Collins where I was responsible for delivering water to Farmers for agriculture. I drove trucks, ran heavy equipment, and did several other different types of things pertaining to taking care of water.  Once that opportunity ran its course, I returned to school at Aims Community College for business and began working for the West Greeley Conservation District. I work for Houston Gardens which is a Community Gardens and outdoor space dedicated to allowing people to learn more about Colorado and Explore Learning for themselves. I have worked there for 3 years, and have enjoyed it very much. Once I was finished at Aims Community College I transferred to the University of Northern Colorado to finish my degree in marketing. I looked to graduate in fall December 2021. Upon graduation I hope to land a job in either sales marketing, or some field within  personal relations.

 <h2>Skill #1</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>HUMILITY</dt>
  <dd>- Humility is my number one skill on this list because I believe that no matter how smart  or strong you are, if you are not able to learn to take criticism and learn from your mistakes then you  will never grow. There are many times in all the jobs I've worked at where I have messed up very badly, but it was through a humble and honest approach that I learned the most from something. Not being willing to take accountability and say that I was wrong only further kicks the can down the road. Hiring me 1 sure that there is transparency and humble interactions between me and all those in the company.
</dd>


	  
	  
<h2>Skill #2</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>DETAIL ORIENTED</dt>
  <dd>- Detail oriented is a skill I value because I think that a lot of times people Miss certain things that make a job that much better. For example, why do lots of landscaping jobs it is very easy to finish the job and call it good enough without taking the extra time to make sure that things look good. Trying to be deal oriented I found makes people appreciate the work you do much more. If you are skipping out on the small things, then there is a chance that you may skip out on big things as well. That's not acceptable Iron Man 1 sure that the little things are accounted for and taken into a serious light.
</dd>
 
	
	  
<h2>Skill #3</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>CRITICAL THINKING</dt>
  <dd>- Critical thinking is a skill that I have gotten much better at through going to college. Being able to look at a situation and think critically in order to solve the problem is something I look forward to at a job. There's more than one way to get to New York as my grandpa says oh, and I believe that trying to think differently and Innovative Lee is something that many companies miss these days. Hiring me will ensure that all ideas are spoken and thought of critically in order to achieve the best possible outcome in a situation.
</dd>
  
	  
	  
	  
<h2>Skill #4</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>COMMUNICATION</dt>
  <dd>- Communication has always been something I fail that I have been successful at, but always needing to continually improve. All the jobs I've ever worked at, the communication has always been poor which has disappointed me. I feel that companies need to communicate with their employees in order to better their results in what they are trying to accomplish. Whether that be texting, emailing, and speaking within a 24-hour basis, being able to interpret what a person is trying to convey is important for business Affairs. Hiring me will help ensure that communication is skipping directly and responsibly with a feedback loop  guaranteeing success.
</dd>
   

	  
<h2>Skill #5</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>MARKETING</dt>
  <dd>- As a marketing manager at the University of Northern Colorado, I have accumulated an incredible amount of knowledge in the area of marketing. Not only have I been able to learn about consumer Behavior, digital advertising and promotion, sales,  and market research, I have learned to be a better person. In my time at UNC  I have been able to build my portfolio in a way where I have consulted with several different companies and have learned how to deal with different kinds of people. And in particular, I enjoy the sales aspect of marketing because it is fun to try to pitch something in a way where you can accomplish a win.  Hiring me will help ensure that marketing efforts are headed in the right direction at your company.
