                <h3>PROS</h3>
                <p>Part of the economic implications of climate change is that if the Earth were to be changing its overall temperature, then the economics of all major countries in the world would be affected by their dependability on natural resources. For example many fishermen and Farmers depend on the production of fishing and produce based on the seasonal patterns of the Earth's weather. If these patterns are disrupted anyway, then seasonal rains  may not be present in order to raise crops and livestock. Cities such as New Orleans as well, which sits below sea level in some areas, runs the risk of flooding and costly damage to its City. This takes a huge economical burden on cities to repair.

                <h3>CONS</h3>
                <p> However, the implications of  addressing climate change where there is no urgency can exploit several millions and billions of dollars towards unnecessary funding of earthcare. If climate change is not as distressing as we believe, then there's no reason to switch over to Electric power and resources that are sustainable but not as economical. Oil and natural gas are critical elements in the structure of the United States of America to make the world run together smoothly. Cities like California already have rolling blackouts because of lack of electricity. More electric cars that don't depend on oil and natural gas will further damage people's abilities to make progress, thus putting more economical strain on countries.
