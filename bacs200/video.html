	    Skill #1   -   HUMILITY
	    
	    	-Humility is my number one skill on this list because I believe that no matter how smart  or strong you are, if you are not able to learn to take criticism and learn from your mistakes then you  will never grow. There are many times in all the jobs I've worked at where I have messed up very badly, but it was through a humble and honest approach that I learned the most from something. Not being willing to take accountability and say that I was wrong only further kicks the can down the road. Hiring me 1 sure that there is transparency and humble interactions between me and all those in the company.

        
	    Skill #2   -   DETAIL ORIENTED
	    
	    	- Detail oriented is a skill I value because I think that a lot of times people Miss certain things that make a job that much better. For example, why do lots of landscaping jobs it is very easy to finish the job and call it good enough without taking the extra time to make sure that things look good. Trying to be deal oriented I found makes people appreciate the work you do much more. If you are skipping out on the small things, then there is a chance that you may skip out on big things as well. That's not acceptable Iron Man 1 sure that the little things are accounted for and taken into a serious light.

        
	    Skill #3   -   CRITICAL THINKING
	    
	    	- Critical thinking is a skill that I have gotten much better at through going to college. Being able to look at a situation and think critically in order to solve the problem is something I look forward to at a job. There's more than one way to get to New York as my grandpa says oh, and I believe that trying to think differently and Innovative Lee is something that many companies miss these days. Hiring me will ensure that all ideas are spoken and thought of critically in order to achieve the best possible outcome in a situation.

        
	    Skill #4   -   COMMUNICATION
	    
	    	- Communication has always been something I fail that I have been successful at, but always needing to continually improve. All the jobs I've ever worked at, the communication has always been poor which has disappointed me. I feel that companies need to communicate with their employees in order to better their results in what they are trying to accomplish. Whether that be texting, emailing, and speaking within a 24-hour basis, being able to interpret what a person is trying to convey is important for business Affairs. Hiring me will help ensure that communication is skipping directly and responsibly with a feedback loop  guaranteeing success.

	
            Skill #5   -   MARKETING
	    
	    	-As a marketing manager at the University of Northern Colorado, I have accumulated an incredible amount of knowledge in the area of marketing. Not only have I been able to learn about consumer Behavior, digital advertising and promotion, sales,  and market research, I have learned to be a better person. In my time at UNC  I have been able to build my portfolio in a way where I have consulted with several different companies and have learned how to deal with different kinds of people. And in particular, I enjoy the sales aspect of marketing because it is fun to try to pitch something in a way where you can accomplish a win.  Hiring me will help ensure that marketing efforts are headed in the right direction at your company.
